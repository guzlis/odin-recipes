    <h2>Description:</h2>

    <p>This classic greek chicken soup is perfect for cold winter evenings. Its egg-lemon sauce is guaranteed to give you an extra dose of vitamin C, while the rest of it will keep you warm and cozy. Traditionally, it is made from scratch by boiling a whole chicken, but for all of our time's sake, this version of the recipe is weekday evening friendly and should take around 30 minutes </p>
