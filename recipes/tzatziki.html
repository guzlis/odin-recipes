    <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Meat, vegetables, salad, sauce, side dish, main dish...does not matter, tzatziki goes with everything. This yoghurt-cucumber sauce is easy to make and will enhance anything it's being served with.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium sized cucumber</li>
        <li>1.5 cups plain greek yoghurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>2+ medium cloves of garlic <em>(again, any recipe that says that 1-2 cloves will suffice does not know what it's talking about)</em></li>
        <li>0.5 teaspoons of fine sea salt</li>
        <li>1 box grater </li>
        <li>1 serving bowl</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Using the large holes of your box grater, grate the cucumber </li>
        <li>One handful at a time, take the grated cucumber pieces and lightly squeeze them in your hand to remove excess moisture. Put the squeezed cucumber pieces into the bowl and repeat until the entire cucumber is done </li>
        <li>Add the yoghurt, herbs, olive oil, juice,salt and garlic to the bowl, stir to blend</li>
        <li>Let the tzatziki rest for at least five minutes (preferably more than an hour so that the flavors can really unfold)</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust with herbs, lemon juice and/or salt if necessary</li>
    </ol>
    <p>And there you have it! Your own tzatziki, ready to be served! Any leftover tzatziki should be stored in the fridge for up to 4 days.</p>
